-Created a GUI application that draws an oval which the user can drag around the JPanel.

-Created a GUI application that allows the user to draw one line by dragging the mouse on the JPanel.

-Modifing the previous exercise to allow the user to draw only three lines on the GUI application.Store the drawn lines in an array to be able to redraw them again when the app is repainted.

-In the pervious exercise the user can only draw a certain number of lines because of the fixed array size.Modifing the pervious exercise, by storing the lines in an ArrayList, to allow an unlimited number.
