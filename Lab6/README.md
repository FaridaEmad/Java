-Created a GUI application that draws an oval that the user can drag around the JPanel.

-Created a GUI application that allows the user to draw one line by dragging the mouse on the JPanel.

-Modifying the previous exercise to allow the user to draw only three lines on the GUI application. Store the drawn lines in an array to be able to redraw them again when the app is repainted.

-In the previous exercise, the user can only draw a certain number of lines because of the fixed array size.Modifying the previous exercise by storing the lines in an ArrayList to allow an unlimited number.
