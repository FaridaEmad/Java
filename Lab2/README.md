# Lab 2
In this lab I created a Parent class that has two attributes: num1 & num2 and sum( ) that calculates the total sum of num1 and num2. After that, I created a Child class which inherits the Parent and has a num3 
attribute. The Child class should override the sum( ) to calculte the total sum of the three numbers.

Second, I created a Shape class which have a dim attribute and an abstract calculateArea( ),the shape will have three subclasses Rectangle, Triangle and Circle. Finally, create a Picture class which will have one method sumAreas( ) which accepts any three shapes as parameters and return the total sum of their areas.
